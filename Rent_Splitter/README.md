# RentSplitter

When I was apartment hunting with roommates, one of the hardest conversations was:  
**"How do we fairly split rent?"**

Every room was different in size, some rooms were shared, and the rent wasn’t cheap. So, to make things easier (and avoid awkward arguments), I built this **RentSplitter** — a Java code that helps divide rent fairly based on room size and how many people live in each room.

It’s simple, transparent, and built for real-life situations.

RentSplitter takes in:
- Total rent amount
- Number of rooms + square footage
- Number of people living in each room

It then calculates how much **each person should pay** based on:
- Their room's share of total space
- How many people are splitting that room

=== Example Rent Splitter ===
Enter total rent amount: $3000
Enter total apartment square footage: 1200
Enter number of rooms: 3

Enter square footage for Room 1: 300
Enter number of people in Room 1: 1

Enter square footage for Room 2: 500
Enter number of people in Room 2: 2

Enter square footage for Room 3: 400
Enter number of people in Room 3: 1

=== Rent Breakdown ===
Person 1 (Room 1): $750.00
Person 2 (Room 2): $625.00
Person 3 (Room 2): $625.00
Person 4 (Room 3): $1000.00
